Take you anywhere I'm ready
Give you anything I'm carefree
Seems like I'm the only thing that you need
It's easy, not so hard to make you happy
While everybody's screamin' shoutin'
We're so chill out here just vibin'
Tryin' to spread this peacefulness with y'all
Our holiday's just getting started
Just be kind and open hearted
Feel the breeze and let God bless us all
(Doko ni ikō Hachikō...)
You've been patiently waiting for me
You've been patiently waiting for me
Doko ni ikō Hachikō
This time I'll never let you go
Doko ni ikō Hachikō
This time I'll never let you go
You've been patiently waiting for me
Went through everything to reach you
There' so many ways to please you
You can pick whatever you'd like to do
Anything that satisfies your soul
While everybody's screamin' shoutin'
We're so chill out here just vibin'
Tryin' to spread this peacefulness with y'all
Our holiday's just getting started
Just be kind and open hearted
Feel the breeze and let God bless us all
(Doko ni ikō Hachikō...)
You've been patiently waiting for me
You've been patiently waiting for me
Doko ni ikō Hachikō
This time I'll never let you go
Doko ni ikō Hachikō
This time I'll never let you go
You've been patiently waiting for me
Doko ni ikō Hachikō
This time I'll never let you go
We don't need to rush, take it slow
This time, I'll never let you go
Doko ni ikō Hachikō
This time I'll never let you go
We don't need to rush, take it slow
This time, I'll never let you go
