[Verse 1]
Take you anywhere, I'm ready
Give you anything, I'm carefree
Seems like I'm the only
thing that you need
It's easy, not so hard to
make you happy (Hey, hey, hey)
[Refrain]
While everybody's
screamin', shoutin'
We're so chill out here,
just vibin'
Tryin' to spread this
peacefulness with y'all, mm
Our holiday's just getting
started
Just be kind and open hearted
Feel the breeze and let
God bless us all, hey
